# What is Ewallet 6 and How to Use It?
 
Ewallet 6 is a digital wallet app that allows you to store and manage your money, cards, and passwords securely. You can use your ewallet to pay for bus and train fares, parking, parking meters and tolls. Just type your ewallet number on the machine or keypad to pay. You'll receive a receipt to show you paid, and you'll be sent an ewallet confirmation code. You can then use this code to pay for another transaction.

Ewallet 6 also supports ATM withdrawals and PIN-based access to ATMs. You can access up to 50 ATMs in your local area for PIN-based withdrawals and ATM PINs are read from the card's NFC chip. The company is aiming to expand the ATMs that can be used, but even if they don't, at least there's the option to have your card removed and replaced in the event of loss or theft.
 
To use Ewallet 6, you need to download the app from the App Store or Google Play and create an account with a PIN. You can also use a serial key to activate your account. A serial key is a unique code that identifies your device and allows you to access your ewallet. You can find your serial key in the app settings or on the back of your card. You can also request a new serial key if you lose or change your device.
 
Once you have your account and serial key, you can add money to your ewallet using various methods. You can load money from your bank account, credit card, debit card, or PayPal. You can also receive money from other ewallet users or through paper banknotes. Paper banknotes are special notes that have an NFC chip embedded in them. You can scan the chip with your phone or card reader to add the money to your ewallet.
