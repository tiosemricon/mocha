## Introduction
 
Pokemon Resolute Version takes place in the Cylon region, a land that is divided into two parts by a huge mountain range. The eastern part is ruled by the Sylon Academy, a prestigious institution that trains elite trainers and researchers. The western part is home to the mysterious Team Mirage, a criminal organization that seeks to revive the ancient Pokemon Regirock, Regice, and Registeel. You are a young trainer who lives in Cedar City, a peaceful town in the eastern part of Cylon. One day, you receive a letter from Professor Avery, inviting you to his lab to receive your first Pokemon and start your journey. Along the way, you will meet many friends and foes, including Kelvin and Alain, two rival trainers who have different goals and personalities; Eliza, a mysterious girl who claims to be from another world; and Selena, the leader of Team Mirage who has a mysterious connection to you.
